<h1>Views</h1>
<p>
  Instead of having to dig into the JSON objects provided by the Shopify AJAX
  API, look up an element in the DOM, and update the HTML by hand, views do all
  of this work for you behind the scenes. You simply define your templates in
  your HTML code the same way you would write a Liquid template for your store's
  theme, and let shopify-cart take care of the rest.
